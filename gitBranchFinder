Prompt: 
write me a powershell script. I want the script to accept a folder path. Then for each folder in the path, iterate through and get the current git branch of that folder, then output the final results in the format '{folderName}|{gitbranch}

Answer:
Certainly! Below is a PowerShell script that accepts a folder path as an argument, iterates through each
subdirectory (assuming it's a Git repository), retrieves the current Git branch for each directory, and outputs
the result in the specified format (`{folderName}|{gitbranch}`).

```powershell
# Define a function to get the current git branch of a given path
function Get-GitBranch {
    param (
        [string]$path
    )

    # Check if the directory is a Git repository
    if (Test-Path "$path\.git\HEAD") {
        # Read the content of HEAD file to get the current branch reference
        $headContent = Get-Content "$path\.git\HEAD" -Raw
        if ($headContent -match 'ref: refs/heads/(.*)') {
            return $matches[1]
        } else {
            return "No branch found"
        }
    } else {
        return "Not a Git repository"
    }
}

# Check if a folder path is provided as an argument
if ($args.Length -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "Please provide a folder path."
    exit
}

$folderPath = $args[0]

# Ensure the provided path exists and is a directory
if (Test-Path $folderPath -PathType Container) {
    # Get all subdirectories in the specified path
    $folders = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Directory

    foreach ($folder in $folders) {
        # Get the current git branch for each folder
        $gitBranch = Get-GitBranch -path $folder.FullName
        Write-Host "$($folder.Name)|$gitBranch"
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "The provided path is not a valid directory."
}
```

### How to Use the Script:
1. **Save the script**: Save this script in a `.ps1` file, for example, `Get-GitBranches.ps1`.
2. **Run the script**: Open PowerShell or Windows Terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the script.
You can run the script by passing the path to the directory you want to scan as an argument:
   ```powershell
   .\Get-GitBranches.ps1 "C:\path\to\your\folder"
   ```
3. **Output**: The script will output the folder name and its current Git branch for each subdirectory that is a
Git repository.

This script assumes that each directory containing a `.git` folder is a Git repository, which should be true if
you're looking at typical project directories in many version control systems like GitHub or Azure DevOps.
Adjustments might be needed depending on your specific environment and how other types of repositories are
structured.
